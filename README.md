What is Telestai?
----------------

Telestai is the basis for a network of decentralised information and media platforms. It will act as the core consensus
layer and network that drives an ecosystem of media and information with privacy and censorship resistance at its heart. 
Rather than 'big corporate' farming the data of users as they simply browse the internet, users will be granted the 
opportunity to retain their data for their own privacy or be allowed to monetise their own meta data by selling it to willing 
purchasers on a marketplace. 

Utillising an ecosystem of interconnected services, Telestai will further net neutrality for users, their content and 
information published through it. Additionally, it will prioritise provenance of content. With the advent of AI, validating 
whether content is true, original or accurate via a digital signature of creation will prevent 'deep fakes', false reporting and
plagiarism in the digital sphere. 

Additionally, Telestai will foster an ecosystem of sufficiently decentralised services and platforms for its citizens to use. 
In doing so, it will provide these members the freedom of expression and creativity that mainstream social media and platforms 
do not, while couching that in a responsible framework of conduct. The 'Document of Agreement' will ensure appropriate action 
can be taken against such content that broaches universally accepted standards of society whilst protecting the freedom of 
speech and expression that has for centuries been the bedrock of human freedom. 

To finish on the words of the Whitepaper:

_While Telestai as a project aims are to birth this ecosystem, it is the community that will breath life into the bold vision. 
The digital foundations of the future are now laid._
